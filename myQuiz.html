/*************** Algorithm ******************

1. Create two arrays: questions and answers.
2. Test with an if statement to make sure index is valid.
3. Display the correct index of element from questions.
4. Get their answer from the answer textbox
5. Test if their answer equals the corresponding index in the answers list using an if statement in checkAnswers.
5. Make local variable equal true or false depending on correct/false response, then return. 
6. If return is true, then add one to the score and show that it is Correct.
7. If return is false, show that it is Incorrect.
8. If index equals the index of the last element then alert whatever is held in var score.
