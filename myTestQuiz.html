/*************** Algorithm ******************

1. Create two arrays: questions and answers
2. Create an if statement that runs through to display each element of questions when the button is clicked
3. Get their answer from the answer textbox
4. Test if their answer equals the corresponding index in the answers list
5. Return true or false depending on correct/false response
6. If return is true, then add one to the score and alert Correct
7. If return is false, alert Incorrect
