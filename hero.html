<p>     Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy in 1254. He traveled to China when he was just 17 years old. Along the way he visited many great sites such as Jerusalem and the Gobi Desert. He lived in China for many years and worked for the ruler Kublai Khan. When he returned to Venice, his tales were turned into a book titled <i>The Travels of Marco Polo.</i> This book became very popular across Europe and was translated into multiple languages. It informed Europeans about life in East Asia.

Marco Polo is important to me because he is a key figure not only in Italian history, but world history as well. He brought major information to Europe about countries across the world. His stories introduced Europeans to East Asia and made them less wary of those countries. It sparked a greater understanding of the eastern world for the West, and of the western world for the East. When I was in 5th grade, I did a project on him and learned how influential his travels were in shaping the current relationship between Europe and Asia.
